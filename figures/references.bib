	abstract = {Is social capital a substitute or a complement to formal institutions for achieving economic growth? A number of recent micro studies suggest that interpersonal trust has its greatest impact on economic performance when court institutions are relatively weak. The conventional wisdom from most macro studies, however, is that social capital is unconditionally good for growth. On the basis of the micro evidence, we outline an investment game between a producer and a lender in an incomplete-contracts setting. A key insight is that social capital will have the greatest effect on the total surplus from the game at lower levels of institutional strength and that the effect of social capital vanishes when institutions are very strong. When we bring this prediction to an empirical cross-country growth regression, it is shown that the marginal effect of social capital (in the form of interpersonal trust) decreases with institutional strength. Our results imply that a one standard deviation rise in social capital in weakly institutionalized Nigeria should increase economic growth by 1.8 percentage points, whereas the same increase in social capital only increases growth by 0.3 percentage points in strongly institutionalized Canada.},

Building on prior research, the current study investigates the relationships between prior contact, victimization, and seven measures of trust and confidence in the police and courts. This study responds to calls for the relationships between trust and confidence in the criminal justice system, race/ethnicity, prior contact, and victimization to be investigated within a single study. Although rare in prior research, outcomes of trust and confidence in local police and courts are individually investigated within the same sample simultaneously. As a first, the current study also separates prior contact by police, courts, community corrections, and institutional corrections and examines four types of victimization (direct violent, vicarious violent, direct non-violent, vicarious non-violent). The latter allows for an examination of potentially more nuanced relationships between victimization and trust and confidence in the police and in the courts.},

Victimization signiﬁcantly reduces vertical trust (in the local police) but has no robust eﬀect on measures of horizontal trust.

Justice systems of dubious quality provide thin shields against this crime crisis, despite substantial international and domestic investment in justice reform. Indeed, there is growing concern that crime will undermine justice reform efforts. Scholars and practitioners have pointed out that public frustration with crime, coupled with dissatisfaction with justice institutions, can lead citizens to reject reform efforts. Still, the micro-level relationships between crime and public support of the justice system have been understudied. Using public opinion data from the Latin American Public Opinion Project ({LAPOP}), this study aims to add to the literature by examining the effects of victimization and fear of crime on public trust in the justice system. The results indicate that crime can erode public support for the justice system, but the mechanics of this relationship vary according to national context.},

	abstract = {Numerous reports suggest that the recent increase in crime poses a profound threat to the stability of newly established electoral democracies in Latin America. This study uses {AmericasBarometer} survey data from 10 countries to test hypotheses concerning the relationship between crime victimization and two different measures of public support for democracy, satisfaction with the way democracy works ({SWD}), and preference for democracy as a form of government ({PFD}). Using hierarchical logistic modeling, we find that people who have been crime victims during the previous year are significantly more likely to express lower levels of {SWD} but that {PFD} is not sensitive to crime victimization, net of several individual and country-level control variables. Thus, individuals who experienced crime directly may hold governments responsible for their vulnerability to crime, yet their victimization does not erode endorsing democracy as a preferred form of government. The findings argue strongly in favor of treating public support for democracy as a multifaceted phenomenon and testing for the effects of crime victimization on different measures of support for democracy.
